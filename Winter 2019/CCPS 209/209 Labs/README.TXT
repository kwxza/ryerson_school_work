PROJECT TITLE: CCPS 209 LABS
VERSION or DATE: WINTER 2019
AUTHORS: Kasaine Kipusi

All the code I have produced has been 
commented.

Some of the Swing labs have been modified
somewhat to produce slightly different
behaviour from the original requirements.

Mondrian will show different colours each time
it is opened.

ParticleField will sequentially add particles
to the window until it reaches the particle
limit set.

Lissajous can generate a random curve of 
random colour each time the Random
button is clicked.
