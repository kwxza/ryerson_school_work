Lab 5 - Building a MaxHeap


Create a file called Lab5-YourStudentNumber.py. Incorrectly named files will receive a mark of zero.

First, create a method called getName() that returns your name. If this does not work, you will receive a mark of zero.

A class called MyHeap is given. Implement the follow methods: __init__(self, array) creates the initial array and build the heap using the O(n) method; insert(self, data) should insert a new element in the heap;  heapify(self) should ensure that the heap property is maintained after insertion; extractFirst() should return the first element of the heap; __len__() should return the size of the heap in O(1); getData(self) should return the array.

You should use a single list to fill data. 

You may not use heapq to implement this.

Use Lab5Tester.py to test your code
Example command line:
$python Lab5Tester.py Lab5-123456789.py
