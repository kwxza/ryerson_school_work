Summary:
--------

Given: You are given a Python Class template, and a list of words in the
       file 'american-english-no-accents.txt'. In the template 

Task:  Write a recursive trie data structure. Each node should store either 
       a character or a word. Then, implement the autocomplete method. This
       method should recursively explore the trie and return a list of all
       words in the trie that match that prefix. The list must be in
       alphabetical order.

Example:
       Given the words 'dad', 'daddy', 'daddio', 'danny', 'mum',
       and 'mummy', the trie should look like this:
											|  |
											  \
                                  |d|m|
                                 /     \
                              |a|       |u|
                            /             \
                          |d | n|         |m|
                         /      \          \
                       |d | #|  danny    |m | #| 
                     /      \             /    \
                  |i | y|   dad        mummy   mum    
                /      \
             daddio   daddy                

       When the prefix 'da' is autocompleted, the list returned should be:
       ['dad', 'daddio', 'daddy', 'danny']. When the prefix '' is given, 
       every word in the trie should be returned, in alphabetical order. When
       the prefix 'uncl' is given, an empty list should be returned.

Notes: Ensure that duplicate words do not get added to the trie twice. 
       Both lower and upper case letters will be used. Consider them as
       seperate characters, upper case letters coming before lower case. 
       The file 'american-english-no-accents.txt' is used by the tester
       but you can write your own test dictionary and tester program.
