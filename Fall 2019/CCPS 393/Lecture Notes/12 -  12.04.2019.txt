  - refers to determining which program behaviour to execute based on data types.

Q & A:

Pass by Reference in C and C++: Function Calls

  In both C and C++, arguments are passed by value.
  Sometimes the value is an address (this is called pass by reference in some languages.
	
	C/C++ syntax is the same for declaring a pointer.

C:
	function:     	myfunc(int *n, int *m)
	main:		myfunc(&a, &b)

C++:
	function:	myfunc2(int &r, int data)  reference
	main:		myfunc2(c, d)
