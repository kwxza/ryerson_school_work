Constructor Overloading:

Recall that it is necessary to initialize memory in both C and C++.
 For object data in C++, can use:
	- inline inialization
	- constructor

  We will combine function overloading with constructors.


The 'this' implicit parameter:
  
  When you say:
	object.function(...)

  it gets converted to:
	Function(object,...)

  To refer to the implicitly passed object, use the term 'this' as a pointer to the object.


Operator Overloading:


Pointers:

List Implementation Choices:
  - Arrays
  - Vectors
  - Linked list


Operators for Memory Allocation and Deallocation:
		C		C++
Allocation	malloc()	new
De-allocation	free()		delete
Pointer Ref.	->		->
